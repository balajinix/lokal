This library has code to publish to social media pages.

On facebook, we can post messages, photos and links to all the pages administered by a user account, who's access_key is given as input.

On twitter, we can post @mentions to users who are tweeting about select topics of our interest.

This code is written/tested on ubuntu and runs on AWS. But you should be able to run it on any machine just fine.

Requirements:

1. python 2.6+
2. sudo apt-get install git
3. sudo apt-get install python-pip
4. pip install python-twitter
5. pip install facepy
6. A facebook user account and pages administrered by that user.
7. A twitter account and its credentials.
